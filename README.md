# 🔄 GNOME Routines

**Automate your GNOME desktop with powerful triggers and actions.**

GNOME Routines brings intelligent automation to your Linux desktop. Set up rules that automatically adjust your system settings based on what you're doing, when you're working, or which apps you're using. Inspired by Samsung's Modes and Routines, reimagined for GNOME.

## 🚀 Usage

### Creating Your First Routine

1. Open **GNOME Extensions** and find **GNOME Routines** settings
2. Click **Add Routine** to create a new automation
3. Give your routine a descriptive name
4. Add **triggers** (when should this run?)
   - Example: "Chrome is running" or "After 6 PM on weekdays"
5. Add **actions** (what should happen?)
   - Example: "Change wallpaper" or "Enable Do Not Disturb"
6. Save and watch your desktop adapt to you!

### Example Routines

**🌙 Night Mode**
- **Trigger**: After 8 PM, every day
- **Action**: Change to dark wallpaper

**💼 Focus Mode**
- **Trigger**: Work apps running (IDE, Terminal)
- **Action**: Enable Do Not Disturb

**🎮 Gaming Setup**
- **Trigger**: Steam is running
- **Action**: Change wallpaper to gaming theme

## 🛠️ Development

### Building

```bash
npm run build        # Build once
npm run watch        # Watch mode for development
```

### Architecture

GNOME Routines follows a modular architecture:
- **Engine**: Pure TypeScript core logic, platform-agnostic
- **Adapters**: GNOME Shell integration layer
- **UI**: LibAdwaita-based preferences interface

This design allows the core logic to be tested independently and potentially ported to other platforms.
